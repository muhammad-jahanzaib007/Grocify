- **Reorder Alerts & Automation**: Auto-generate alerts or purchase orders based on predefined reorder points and stock levels.
- **Quotation & Price Comparison**: Request and compare quotes from multiple vendors.
- **Purchase Returns**: Manage returns to vendors for defective or expired items and adjust inventory accordingly.

## Inventory Management Module
- **Real-Time Stock Tracking**: Monitor current stock levels using barcodes/RFID, with filtering by location, price, company, and category.
- **Barcode/Label and Scale Integration**: Integrate barcode scanners and scales for quick check-ins and selling products by weight.
- **Batch/Lot & Expiration Tracking**: Track perishable items by batch/lot number and expiry dates.
- **Multi-Location Support**: Manage inventory across multiple store locations with filtering and sorting options.
- **Inventory Ledger**: Record all product movements, including manual adjustments for damages, theft, and spoilage.

## Sales (POS) Module
- **Checkout & Payment Processing**: Enable fast transactions with live product search, auto-scanning, and multiple payment methods (cash, card, gift card, mobile pay).
- **Cart Management**: Manage items in cart with functionalities to add, update quantity, apply discounts, and remove items.
- **Unique Receipt Generation**: Generate unique receipt identifiers (e.g., using datetime till seconds).
- **Credit Sales**: Allow recording sales as credit in a customer's account, maintaining invoice numbers and pending amounts.
- **Sales Ledger & Returns**: Maintain detailed records of sales and manage returns, either full or partial, with receipt regeneration if necessary.

## Expense Management Module
- **General Expense Tracking**: Record store expenses such as utilities, rent, maintenance, and payroll.
- **Vendor Bills and Payments**: Manage recurring bills and track payments, with filtering by vendor and location.
- **Budgeting & Forecasting**: Compare actual spending against budgets with planned versus actual analytics.

## Customer Management Module

- **Loyalty/Rewards Programs**: Track customer points on purchases, issue loyalty rewards, and manage targeted promotions and coupons.
- **Gift Cards & Store Accounts**: Manage stored-value cards or customer credit accounts.
- **Customer Support & Feedback**: Record customer feedback, complaints, and support queries.

## Analytics & Reporting Module
- **Sales, Inventory, and Expense Reports**: Provide daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries with filtering by product, category, and company.
- **Profit Margins and Forecasting**: Analyze profit margins and use predictive models to forecast sales, expenses, and profits.
- **Operational Dashboards**: Offer visual dashboards for real-time insights and advanced reporting capabilities.

## Access Control Module
- **User Roles & Permissions**: Define and enforce roles (Administrator, Manager, Cashier) using Django's auth system with groups and permissions.
- **Audit Logging & Security**: Log critical operations such as price overrides and sales processing; ensure secure sessions and data integrity.
- **Shift Management & Time Clock**: Record employee shifts and manage time-clock functionalities.

## Proposed Architecture
- **Framework & Structure**: Utilize Django's MVT architecture with separate Django apps for each module (e.g., inventory, sales, purchases, expenses, customers, analytics).
- **Models & Admin**: Define comprehensive models for each entity (Vendor, PurchaseOrder, Product, InventoryItem, SaleTransaction, Expense, Customer, etc.) and customize the Django Admin interface for ease of management.
- **APIs & Integrations**: Develop REST API endpoints (using Django REST Framework) for live search, POS integration, and online order synchronization.
- **Automation & Scheduling**: Implement scheduled tasks for automatic reorder alerts and inventory updates.
- **Access & Security**: Enforce robust access control, user authentication, and audit logging across the application.
- **UX & UX Enhancements**: Provide advanced filtering, sorting, and live search functionalities in dashboards across modules.

## Next Steps
- Validate the proposed architecture and requirements with all stakeholders.
- Design detailed database schemas and UI wireframes for each module.
- Develop an MVP focusing on core functionalities (Inventory, Sales, and Purchasing).
- Iteratively build and test features, beginning with the high-priority modules.
